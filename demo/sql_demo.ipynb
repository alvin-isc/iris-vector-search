    "## Vector Search with IRIS SQL\n",
    "This tutorial covers how to use IRIS as a vector database. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will use a dataset of 2.2k online reviews of scotch (\n",
    "dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/koki25ando/22000-scotch-whisky-reviews) . With our latest vector database functionality, we can leverage the latest embedding models to run semantic search on the online reviews of scotch whiskeys. In addition, we'll be able to apply filters on columns with structured data. For example, we will be able to search for whiskeys that are priced under $100, and are 'earthy, smooth, and easy to drink'. Let's find our perfect whiskey!"
